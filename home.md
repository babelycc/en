What miracles can arise when your creativity meets Web3? **Babelyx** , a unique user-sovereign content community and marketplace, offering an unprecedented creative experience and rights protection for everyone. Let's step into the Web3 world where users reign supreme!

### Why is it called Babelyx?

In the **Book of Genesis** from the Bible, God created the world and humanity, who then spread across the Earth. One day, ancient humans decided to build the **Tower of Babel** . At that time, everyone spoke the same language and shared a common goal, successfully constructing a towering structure. When the tower was about to reach the heavens, God became fearful and confused their language, causing people to be unable to understand each other and to fight among themselves. Consequently, the tower was never completed and eventually crumbled into ruins.

Argentinian writer **Julio Cort치zar** proposed a magical concept in his famous 1941 novella, **The Library of Babel** . This library is a simple yet infinite library containing all possible combinations of letters. In this library, standing at any position and looking around, one would see endless bookshelves composed of countless hexagonal bookcases. Each bookcase contains books where any two adjacent books differ by only one letter. Despite such minuscule differences, if you walk far enough along the bookshelves and take enough turns, you will inevitably find any book you desire. This boundless library contains all languages, all subjects, and all meanings, encompassing the past, present, and all possible futures, waiting to be discovered.

In Eastern Buddhism, there's the concept of the **Three Thousand Great Thousand Worlds** , depicting a macro-to-microcosmic structure of the universe. These worlds consist of countless great thousand worlds (Mah캐saha-loka), each containing numerous middle thousand worlds (Madhya-loka), within which exist the six realms of reincarnation. Each middle thousand world houses numerous small thousand worlds (Saha-loka), each with its own heavens, earth, sentient beings, and various forms of existence, possessing unique life, landscapes, and rules. This concept illustrates the vastness and diversity of the universe, where countless worlds, large and small, exist, each with its distinct characteristics and forms of existence, representing the boundless sentient beings in Buddhism.

**Babelyx** is the community and marketplace of infinite possibilities, a sanctuary for creating, preserving, and realizing every potential.

### What Can Babelyx Do?

Babelyx transforms any content you publish into a **BLX** for free, automatically operating according to built-in contracts, empowering assets to circulate and appreciate autonomously, enhancing everyone's rights and benefits.

As a user, every spontaneous publication you make becomes an encrypted asset and a perpetual store, bringing you continuous revenue and unlocking infinite possibilities.

This is made possible by our patented **BLX** technology, seamlessly integrating the data security of IPFS, the digital ownership of NFTs, and the smart contracts of Ethereum, along with powerful AI-assisted creation, providing you with an unprecedented experience and protection.

BLX Features:

1. **Sealed NFT**
   Since its rise in 2021, NFT technology has garnered significant attention, transforming digital content into unique assets and forging direct, intimate connections between creators, fans, sponsors, and investors. (See [NFTs: Empowering Creators in the Digital World](https://learn.metamask.io/lessons/nfts-and-creators))

   However, NFTs are merely "certificates of authenticity". While the certificates themselves are unreplicable and tamper-proof through blockchain technology, the digital content they refer to is still as vulnerable as traditional internet (Web2) content, lacking privacy protection and being accessible, downloadable, and copyable by anyone. This limits the application scenarios of NFT technology, primarily thriving in the digital art domain.

   **BLX** has a feature of **Sealed NFT** , i.e. "certificates of encrypted existence". It first encrypts each piece of digital content in a decentralized manner, permanently storing it in the IPFS decentralized file system, then mints it into an NFT, fundamentally preventing unauthorized access, copying, and distribution of the digital content. Other users must pay a decryption fee to the Sealed NFT owner to access the actual digital content.

   Thus, BLX uses mathematical principles to absolutely guarantee the privacy and security of your digital content.

2. **Autonomous Marketplace**
   BLX is not just a sealed NFT but also an autonomous marketplace run by smart contracts. Each BLX inherently includes multiple smart contracts, each defining a role's rights, enabling digital assets to support various participant roles and engage in decentralized transactions anytime, anywhere, just like offline assets. For example:

   - Creator Contract : Once the original creator mints digital content into BLX, it automatically becomes an indelible, unalterable, unique, and permanent mark. In all subsequent appreciation of this asset, the original creator will automatically receive corresponding returns according to the contract.
   - Visitor Contract : Sets a decryption fee for visitors. A user who pays the decryption fee becomes an "accessor," able to decrypt and access the digital content.
   - Buyer Contract : Sets a purchase fee for buyers. A user who pays the purchase fee becomes a "holder," owning a certain share of the asset. Holding rights apply to limited-supply shared assets such as book copies, movie tickets, membership statuses, restaurant seats, rental time slots, etc. Users can transfer their limited slots, promoting sharing, circulation, and appreciation.
   - Owner Contract : Records the current owner of the asset and the buyout price for full ownership. Other users can acquire the asset by purchasing it outright, becoming the new owner. Each asset can only belong to one owner at any given time. The access, holding, rental, and other revenue from the asset are enjoyed by its current owner.
   - Additional contracts : Beyond these roles, assets can have more detailed or extended roles such as agents, operators, renters, and more.

   A BLX with multi-role trading contracts operates like a perpetual self-running store. Without owner intervention, the asset can circulate and appreciate among different user roles, providing long-term stable income for creators and maintaining high enthusiasm for various user types.

3. **AI-Assisted Creation**
   Have you ever been stuck in a creative rut, unable to find inspiration despite racking your brains? Don't worry, our AI assistant is always on standby, providing a wisdom-filled inspiration booster. With AI's creative assistance, you will continuously spark new ideas, connecting seemingly unrelated dots into the most brilliant pictures, bringing words to life on paper and making videos more vivid and moving.

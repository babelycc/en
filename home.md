### What is Babelyx?

Babelyx, the multiverse of infinite possibilities.

In the book of Genesis in the Bible, God created the world and humanity, and humans scattered across the earth to multiply and thrive. One day, ancient humans decided to build a tower called the Tower of Babel. At that time, everyone spoke the same language and had a common goal, so they successfully built a tower that reached into the sky. However, when the tower was about to reach the heavens, God became fearful and disrupted the language of humans, making it impossible for them to understand each other. They began to quarrel and the Tower of Babel was never completed, gradually collapsing into ruins.

The Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges wrote a famous novel in 1941 called "The Library of Babel," which introduced a fascinating concept. The Library of Babel is a simple but infinite library that contains all possible combinations of words. In the Library of Babel, regardless of where a person stands, looking around in all directions, there are walls of books extending infinitely, composed of countless hexagonal bookshelves. Any two adjacent books on a shelf differ by only one letter. Despite such a simple and subtle difference, as long as you walk along the walls of books, go around enough bends, you will inevitably find any book you desire. In this boundless library, all combinations of languages, subjects, and meanings exist, encompassing all possibilities of the past, present, and future. Everything already exists, waiting to be discovered.

In Eastern Buddhist philosophy, there is also the concept of the "Three Thousandfold World," which depicts a cosmic structure from the macroscopic to the microscopic level. The "Three Thousandfold World" is composed of countless "MahƒÅsaha-loka" (great thousandfold worlds). Each great thousandfold world contains numerous "Madhya-loka" (middle thousandfold worlds), within which the cycle of existence in the six realms takes place. And each middle thousandfold world contains countless "Saha-loka" (small thousandfold worlds), each with its own celestial realms, earthly realms, sentient beings, and various other forms of existence, possessing unique lives, landscapes, and laws. The "Three Thousandfold World" portrays the boundless vastness and diversity of the universe, asserting that there exist countless worlds within the cosmos, each with its distinct characteristics and forms of existence, reflecting the Buddhist view of the multitude of sentient beings.

Therefore, within the concise and rule-based Library of Babel lies every possibility of the infinite Three Thousandfold World.

Babelyx embodies the infinite possibilities of the great thousandfold world, holding your creations, waiting your discovery.

### PEX: encrypt and secure your rights

The sparks of creativity and the hard work put into creation deserve respect and reward. Therefore, we have encrypted and protected each work at the elliptic curve level of blockchain, fundamentally preventing illegal copying and dissemination. If other users want to appreciate or own your work, they must pay decryption fees to you, safeguarding your rights as a creator. This not only brings long-term and stable income for creators but also keeps users' enthusiasm for participation high.

### IPFS: guarding your data invincibly

Every stroke and every detail of a work is unique. We have adopted IPFS storage protection technology to make every byte of your work invulnerable. IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) is a decentralized, content-addressed, globally distributed file storage system that can fragmentize your work and distribute it among numerous nodes in the global network. This means that even if some nodes fail or are tampered with, your work remains safely stored in other nodes, never lost or counterfeited. Through the Merkle tree hash address, the content of the work is completely locked using mathematical principles, making it impossible even for a Thanos-like figure to alter it.

### NFT: making creators true owners

NFT technology has gained much attention in recent years. It gives unique value to digital assets, breaking away from monopolistic intermediary platforms, and allowing creators to truly own the sovereignty and rights of their published works, establishing direct and close connections with fans, sponsors, and investors. Babelyx can easily transform any work into your personal NFT, injecting an indelible and unalterable mark of ownership into your creations. Each work will be cast into a unique token that cannot be replicated or forged, protecting your authorial rights.

### AIGC: AI-assisted creation

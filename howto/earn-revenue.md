# How to earn money from your Aipp?

Whenever a user uses your application, you can earn revenue based on the usage. For example:

- Assuming you set your revenue rate at 0.03Â¢/Kchars.
- Assuming your app is used by users for a total of 20000K chars, you will earn 20000\*0.03 = 600Â¢, i.e. $6 USD.
